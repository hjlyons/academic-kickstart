# Publication name and optional abbreviated publication name.
publication: "Luminosity Determination using Z→ℓℓ events at √s=13 TeV with the ATLAS detector"
publication_short: "ATLAS Z-Counting"

abstract: "The first publication documenting a new Luminosity measurement method used at the ATLAS detector which monitors the rate of Z-boson production. This analyses the full ATLAS Run-2 dataset and presents the strong stability of the method with respect to time and pileup."
